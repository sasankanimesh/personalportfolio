            Throughout the academic year, I developed a strong foundation in
            both theoretical and practical aspects of computing. The modules
            covered a broad spectrum‚Äîfrom core programming and database
            development to sustainability and professional growth. Engaging in
            hands-on projects, group collaborations, and individual assessments
            not only enhanced my technical proficiency but also strengthened my
            problem-solving, communication, and teamwork skills. This experience
            laid a solid groundwork for further studies and future career

              exploitation, reporting, and post-incident recovery, with exposure
              to tools like Snort, Wireshark, Metasploit, and Nessus. Worked on
              SDN and cloud-based infrastructure, deploying scalable solutions
              using Docker and AWS. This year enhanced both my technical
              capabilities and analytical thinking required for offensive and
              defensive security roles.

                  AI-SecPro is a production-ready, AI-powered web application I
                  built as my final year individual project. It uses a React
                  frontend, Django backend, and integrates GPT-4 and PentestGPT
                  to automate the entire penetration testing lifecycle‚Äîfrom
                  reconnaissance to reporting. The system supports both manual
                  tool usage and full end-to-end workflows, with intelligent
                  next-step suggestions and AI-enriched reporting. It features
                  PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases, async task handling with
                  Celery, secure user management, role-based access, and a
                  modular, scalable architecture designed for real-world
                  offensive security use cases.
