            My ultimate goal is to become a skilled{" "}
            <strong>offensive security professional</strong> who can help
            organizations strengthen their digital defenses. I'm motivated by
            curiosity and a passion for understanding how systems can be broken
            â€” so they can be fixed.
            <br />
            <br />
            I find joy in solving technical challenges, uncovering
            vulnerabilities, and learning how things work under the hood. This
            mindset fuels my interest in ethical hacking, red teaming, and
            penetration testing.
            <br />
            <br />I aim to continuously grow by working on real-world projects,
            collaborating with experienced professionals, and pushing myself
            through hands-on labs, CTFs, and research. My motivation is not just
            to find flaws â€” but to contribute to a safer, more secure digital
            world.
