            My journey into cybersecurity has been hands-on and driven by
            curiosity. I completed the{" "}
            <strong>TryHackMe Pentester Pathway</strong>, which gave me
            practical experience with real-world attack scenarios and security
            challenges.
            <br />
            <br />
            I regularly take part in vulnerable machine labs and challenges to
            improve my problem-solving abilities and offensive mindset. I enjoy
            discovering how systems work, how they can be broken, and how to
            defend them ethically.
            <br />
            <br />I believe learning never stops, so I consistently explore new
            techniques, follow cybersecurity trends, and stay active in the
            community to grow as a professional.
