            I earned my <strong>BSc (Hons) in Computer Security</strong> from
            <strong> Plymouth University, UK</strong>. Throughout my studies, I
            gained in-depth knowledge in key areas such as{" "}
            <strong>penetration testing</strong>,
            <strong> digital forensics</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>network security</strong>,<strong> malware analysis</strong>
            , and <strong>secure software development</strong>.
            <br />
            <br />
            My coursework involved practical lab sessions, real-world
            simulations, and group projects that helped me understand offensive
            and defensive security techniques. I also completed several
            individual assignments focusing on ethical hacking, vulnerability
            assessments, and incident response.
