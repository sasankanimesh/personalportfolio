Built using Django, React, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, the system seamlessly integrates GPT-4 and PentestGPT for real-time analysis, AI-guided testing, and intelligent report generation.\n\nThe platform offers a complete offensive security lifecycleâ€”from reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning to AI-assisted exploitation and professional CVE-informed reporting. AI-SecPro enforces ethical hacking protocols via consent validation, usage boundaries, and risk-based action filtering. It supports gray, black, and white-box testing modes, with secure authentication (JWT), role-based access control, reCAPTCHA, session hardening, and real-time WebSocket updates.\n\nI implemented a dual-database architecture, using PostgreSQL for structured user data and MongoDB for real-time scan results and unstructured AI responses. Tools like Nmap, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Metasploit, SQLMap, and others are orchestrated by the backend and interpreted by GPT-4 to enhance decision-making. AI-SecPro bridges human expertise with machine learning by enabling less-experienced users and professionals to launch guided or automated pentests while ensuring OWASP Top 10 resilience and AI safety.\n\nKey features include:\n- AI-guided full pentest automation and scan interpretation.\n- Role-based dashboards with ethical policy enforcement.\n- Dynamic vulnerability reports with remediation advice.\n- Real-time recon & scanning modules with secure multi-user support.\n- Modular plugin-ready UI and containerized architecture for scale.\n\nThis project is a comprehensive demonstration of my expertise in full-stack secure web development, AI integration, DevSecOps, and offensive cybersecurityâ€”all delivered under a university-supervised individual research project aligned with real-world standards.",

The core objective was to investigate the breach, determine the extent of unauthorized access, and identify which sensitive data had been exposed, ensuring that all findings were thorough, accurate, and legally admissible.\n\nOur investigation meticulously covered the handling, examination, and analysis of digital evidence, adhering to established forensic standards. This included analyzing various forms of digital evidence such as .pst and .dbx email files, as well as email headers contained in a document. We employed a suite of specialized forensic tools including SysTool Outlook PST Viewer, SysTools MailXaminer, 4n6 DBX Forensics Wizard for email file analysis, and investigative tools like VirusTotal, Criminal IP, AbusIP, and Whois Lookup for analyzing attachments, IP addresses, and domains. Our process ensured strict adherence to the Chain of Custody for all collected evidence. The project culminated in a detailed report outlining our findings, expert opinions, and recommending security measures to prevent future incidents and enhance the integrity of the company's data, such as applying patches, restricting services, implementing strong password policies, and developing an incident response plan.\n\nMy individual contribution to this project specifically focused on the *Evidence Classes*. I was responsible for the systematic categorization and meticulous analysis of the various types of digital evidence, including the in-depth examination of .pst files, .dbx files, and email headers. This involved using forensic tools to extract, review, and interpret data from these classes to identify potential misuse, unauthorized access, and other significant activities relevant to the breach.",

The entire infrastructure was automated using shell scripts for streamlined deployment and testing. The second part of the project explored the optimization of media delivery through an adaptive video streaming solution over a Software-Defined Network (SDN). I built a testbed using Mininet, OpenDaylight, and DASH.js to simulate and analyze the impact of network conditions like packet loss on video quality.

        "This project focuses on the role of cryptography in securing blockchain systems by exploring essential components like public and private key encryption, digital signatures, hash functions (such as SHA-256), and Merkle trees. It explains how these elements work together to ensure data integrity, authentication, and trust within decentralized environments. I analyzed how platforms like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger use these cryptographic methods to support secure, transparent transactions without relying on centralized authorities.\n\nThe work also investigates common blockchain vulnerabilitiesâ€”such as 51% attacks, Sybil attacks, and double spendingâ€”and examines how advanced cryptographic technologies like zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption (FHE), and multi-party computation (MPC) can provide enhanced security and privacy for future applications.\n\nThrough this project, I developed a strong understanding of how blockchain and cryptography intersect to create secure and scalable systems. A clean visual accompanies the project to represent core concepts clearly, making it easier to grasp the structure and purpose of cryptographic elements in a blockchain network.",
